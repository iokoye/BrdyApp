Brdy is MVC web application written in C#, Javascript, and HTML.
The user can register an account, sign in, and query bird data via 
geographical location. Once you've signed in, you may toggle between
the home page, seen list, and wish list. 

You can enter state or coordinate information to search area for bird 
species and the result page will populate a Google map and list of bird
sightings with maps markers.
